# Grand Theft Ambulance

Global Gamejam 2013 project: you have to steal organs and sell them ;)

See licsense.txt (CC-BY-NC-SA). Use node.js and brunch.io (npm install; brunch watch --server) to compile a bunch of HTML5 files to release. Then open index.html. Works with Chrome (server required due to XHR requests) and Firefox.
